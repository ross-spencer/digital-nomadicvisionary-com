# Ross Spencer: MADCT Portfolio

![](/images/titles/header.jpg)

Portfolio submitted in support of my Master of Arts in Digital Culture and Technology at Kings College London (2005).

The previous site has been migrated from different domains and some pretty HTML to now appear here in a Just the Docs powered site.

There are also some legacy pages on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/digital.nomadicvisionary.co.uk*).

The old HTML source can be found under the [legacy](https://github.com/ross-spencer/madct/tree/legacy) branch.
